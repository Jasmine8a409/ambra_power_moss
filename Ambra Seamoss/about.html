    <h2>About Ambra</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Ambra — the heart and hands behind Ambra’s Power Moss.
      My wellness journey started when I was searching for natural ways to
      boost my energy, support my immune system, and feel good in my own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fell in love with sea moss because it’s simple, powerful, and versatile.
      After months of learning how to properly clean, soak, and prepare it,
      I began sharing small batches with friends and family. Their results
      and feedback inspired me to turn this passion into Ambra’s Power Moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every product is made with intention — from sourcing wild-crafted sea moss
      to carefully preparing it in my kitchen. My goal is to offer clean,
      wild, and revitalizing sea moss that fits easily into your daily routine.
